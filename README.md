# IDC Hesperapis

A Deseret Alphabet font reproducing the 1868–69 Russell Bros. typeface used in the _Deseret First Book_, _Deseret Second Book_, and _The Book of Mormon_ (1869 ed.).

The majuscules are produced in FontForge from the SVGs at the settings:

```
font_size  := 72pt;
pen_width  := 0.12 * font_size;
pen_height := 0.08 * font_size;
x_height   := 0.5 * font_size;
```

The following adjustments are made manually:

1. All are scaled 80% and moved `(-65.6, 90.5)`.
2. Es is rotated 180°.
3. SVGs are overlapped and in most cases simplified once.
4. Kerning is manually set at +100 to +150.

The minuscules are copied and produced at the settings:

1. All are scaled 80% and moved `(-53.35, -80)`.
